# 462-Project

Portable Gaming Device created with Arduino Mega, touch sensor modules, and LED matrices

I take no credit for the Tetris, Snake, Game of Life, or menu codes.
I altered these codes to work with the touch sensors since they were using a Bluetooth module instead, and to work with the orientation of our LED matrix since ours was different.

Connect Four code is completely original.
